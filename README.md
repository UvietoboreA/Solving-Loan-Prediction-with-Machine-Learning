# 📊 Solving Loan Prediction with Machine Learning: Classification & Regression Challenges 🚀  

Loan prediction is more than just approving or denying applications—it’s about optimizing processes and creating actionable insights for both lenders and borrowers.  

Recently, I explored a comprehensive dataset that posed three unique challenges, each testing different facets of machine learning.

## 🔍 Problem Statements  

### 1️⃣ Eligibility Classification  
**Can we determine whether a customer’s loan application will be approved based on key inputs like income, credit history, and loan term?**  
- Using classification models, I achieved a good accuracy.  
- **Key insights**: Credit history and applicant income emerged as the most influential features.  

### 2️⃣ Loan Term Optimization (Regression)  
For customers with denied loan applications, we tackled two regression tasks:  
- **Task A**: Predict an optimal loan amount for the given term.  
- **Task B**: Suggest an adjusted loan term that would make the requested loan amount feasible.  
💡 **Linear Regression** delivered strong performance for Task B.  
- **Key insights**: Total income and property area significantly impact feasible loan terms.  

### 3️⃣ Loan Amount Prediction (Regression)  
For approved applications, predict the most suitable loan amount based on customer details to ensure responsible lending while meeting customer needs.  
- **Models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting** provided robust predictions.  
- Ensures transparency and accuracy for both lenders and borrowers.
